# Rosehill

Rosehill is a theme for Moodle and is based on the Boost theme which comes standard with Moodle 4.x.

The Boost theme is itself built using Bootstrap 4 and so has many normalised components. The Rosehill theme brings the virtual learning environment in line with current Falmouth University branding and supports Moodle 4.x.
